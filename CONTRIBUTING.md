## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all libraries are properly congigured and any instructions to set-up the workflow to funcion properly mentioned.
2. Update the README.md with checkmark and demo of the simulation along with link to any specific instrutions to get the demo working.
3. Make the simulation in a separate branch with name of the branch representing the simulation and make sure no other experiments are included in that branch
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of the developers.
5. If possible try to include the libraries through a "ExternalLibraries"(Only for Box2D) folder in the repo folder, also try to use GLFW and GLEW libraries(can be incuded through systems include directory)
6. You can use anykind of graphics library and only Xcode projects are being accepted until all the simulaiton are simulated at least once. Hoewver, in future we will accept VS(visual studio) projects.
